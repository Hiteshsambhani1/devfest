## Here we go again

Every year, we run a different competition üòù
Last year it was [HackSquad](https://hacksquad.dev), this year we are running [DevFest AI](https://devfest.ai)

The rules are very basic.

1. Go to DevFest AI - create or join an existing squad.
2. Contribute code for any repository containing AI.
3. Collect points, and by the end of the event, 100 people will get awesome swag (the number might go up!)

We will also run some fun giveaways for swag during the competition.

And, of course, share your fantastic ticket üé´

1. Presenting your profile.
2. Applying for jobs.
3. Or to show how good you are.

You will also be exposed to many open-source sponsors looking for excellent developers: [CopilotKit](https://copilotkit.ai), [Composio](https://composio.dev), [Julep](https://julep.ai), [LLMWare](https://llmware.ai), [Traceloop](https://traceloop.com), [Keep](https://keephq.dev), [Taipy](https://taipy.io), [ToolJet](https://tooljet.io), [Digger.dev](https://digger.dev), and [Classiq](https://classiq.io)!
